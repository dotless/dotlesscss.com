<h1 id="using-less">Using .less</h1>

<h2 id="from-the-command-line">From the command line</h2>

The command line tool is `dotless.Compiler.exe`, and it looks something like this:

    $ dotless.Compiler source [destination]

The `source` is the .LESS file you want to compile, and the `destination` is the (optional) CSS file you want to compile it to. 
If you don't specify a destination, `dotless.Compiler` will base it on the source you specified:

    $ dotless.Compiler style.less style.less.css
    $ dotless.Compiler style.less

Are equivalent.


<h2 id="watching">Watching</h2>

`dotless.Compiler` also comes with an option to watch your `.less` file for any change, and recompile it automatically:

    $ dotless.Compiler style.less --watch

Now, whenever you save your file, `dotless.Compiler` will try to compile it. If there are errors, it will ask you to fix them before continuing.

    Compiling style.less -> style.less.css [Done]
    Hit Enter to stop watching
    Watching style.less for changes
    Found change in file. Recompiling...
    Compiling style.less -> style.less.css [Done]


<h2 id="from-code">From code</h2>

Add a reference to dotless.Core.dll

    using dotless.Core
    
    var factory = new EngineFactory();
    var engine = factory.GetEngine(DotlessConfiguration.Default);
    var css = engine.TransformToCss(new LessSourceObject {Content = "div { width: 1 + 1 }"});

which will output

    div { width: 2; }



<h1 id="the-language">The language</h1>


<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>

These are pretty self-explanatory:

    @nice-blue: #5B83AD;
    @light-blue: @nice-blue + #111;

    #header { color: @light-blue; }

Outputs:

    #header { color: #6c94be; }

Note that variables are actually 'constants' in that they can only be defined once.


<h2 id="mixins">Mixins</h2>

Mixins are a way of including ('mixing in') a bunch of properties from one rule-set into another rule-set. So say we have the following class:

    .bordered {
      border-top: dotted 1px black;
      border-bottom: solid 2px black;
    }

And we want to use these properties inside other rule-sets. Well, we just have to drop in the name of the class where we want the properties, like so:

    #menu a {
      color: #111;
      .bordered;
    }

    .post a {
      color: red;
      .bordered;
    }

The properties of the `.bordered` class will now appear in both `#menu a` and `.post a`. (Note that you can also use `#id`s as mixins)


<h2 id="nested-rules">Nested Rules</h2>

.LESS gives you the ability to use nesting instead of, or in combination with cascading. Lets say we have the following CSS:

    #header { color: black; }
    #header .navigation {
      font-size: 12px;
    }
    #header .logo { 
      width: 300px; 
    }
    #header .logo:hover {
      text-decoration: none;
    }

In .LESS, we can also write it this way:

    #header {
      color: black;

      .navigation {
        font-size: 12px;
      }
      .logo {
        width: 300px;
        :hover { text-decoration: none }
      }
    }

The resulting code is more concise, and mimics the structure of your `html`.


<h2 id="operators">Operators</h2>

Any number, color or variable can be operated on. Here are a couple of examples:

    @base: 5%;
    @filler: @base * 2;
    @other: @base + @filler;

    color: #888 / 4;
    background-color: @base-color + #111;
    height: 100% / 2 + @filler;

The output is pretty much what you expect—.LESS understands the difference between colors and units. If a unit is used in an operation, like in:

    @var: 1px + 5;

.LESS will use that unit for the final output—`6px` in this case.


<h2 id="functions">Functions</h2>

.LESS defines some useful functions which are called using the normal CSS function syntax

    #main {
      color: hsl(0, 100%, 50%)
    }

Is compiled to

    #main {
      color: #ff0000;
    }

See the [function reference](${ Url.Action("Docs", "Home", new { chapterName = "functions" }) }) for a full list of available functions.


<h2 id="namespaces-accessors">Namespaces &amp; Accessors</h2>

Sometimes, you may want to group your variables or mixins, for organizational purposes, or just to offer some encapsulation. 
You can do this pretty intuitively in .LESS—say you want to bundle some mixins and variables under `#bundle`, for later re-use, or for distributing:

    #bundle {
      .button {
        display: block;
        border: 1px solid black;
        background-color: grey;
        :hover { background-color: white }
      }
      .tab { ... }
      .citation { ... }
    }

Now if we want to mixin the `.button` class in our `#header a`, we can do:

    #header a {
      color: orange;
      #bundle > .button;
    }

.LESS also allows you to access specific properties or variables from different rule-sets:

    #defaults {
      @width: 960px;
      @color: black;
    }

    .article { color: #294366; }

    .comment {
      width: #defaults[@width];
      color: .article['color']; 
    }

Variables and accessors can be used almost interchangeably, use whichever is best suited for the situation—accessors 
might make more sense if that property only needs to be accessed once.


<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

Scope in .LESS is very similar to that of programming languages. Variables and mixins are first looked for locally, 
and if they aren't found, the compiler will look in the parent scope, and so on. Note that the order of declaration does matter.

    @var: red;

    #page {
      @var: white;
      #header {
        color: @var; // white
      }
    }


<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>

Both C-style and inline comments are authorized:

    /* One hell of a comment */
    @var: red;

    // Get in line!
    @var: white;


<h2 id="importing">Importing</h2>

Importing works pretty much as expected. You can import a `.less` file, and all the variables in it will be available. If the file is a `.less`, the extension is optional:

    @import "library";
    @import "typo.css";
